            <br>
            Pharmacognosy derives from two Greek words, pharmakon or drug, and "gnosis" or knowledge. Thus,
            Pharmacognosy (chemistry and biology of natural products) is the study of natural substances found in
            terrestrial and marine organisms (plants, animals, or microbes). Pharmacognosy has undergone significant
            change in recent years and today represents a highly interdisciplinary science which is one of five major
            areas of pharmaceutical education.
            <br><br>
            Despite convincing progress in Synthetic Chemistry, plants are the most important sources for preventive and
            curative medical preparations. WHO has estimated that at least 80% of all the global inhabitants rely on
            curative medical systems of medicine for their primary health needs and these systems are largely plant
            based.
            <br><br>
            Research in Pharmacognosy is important because it leads new types of therapeutic moiety; increased
            understanding of the pharmacological, ecological and biochemical roles of molecules produced by nature;
            information on herbal medicines; and new methods for the analysis of drugs and herbal formulations. Research
            in the department of Pharmacognosy focused on analysis of medicinal plants including isolation,
            purification, identification and structure determination of bioactive substances from plant sources.
