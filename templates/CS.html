                    The Department of Computer Engineering offers 8 semesters courses with a compulsory 1 Year project
                    in the last year. Students are exposed to the latest software and development tools as per the need
                    of
                    the day. Computer Engineering is the field which deals with analyzing and designing hardware,
                    software,
                    and operating systems for a computer system. The Computer Center is available for internet access to
                    all
                    students of the department. Software for Database Management, Computer Graphics, Low Level
                    Programming, Networking, Internet Applications etc. is used for developing customized applications.
                    To
                    achieve a student centric approach is practiced by all faculty members. All the faculties have good
                    expertise in their respective domains.

            <h2>Aim of the Course</h2>
            Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several
            fields of electrical engineering and computer science required
            to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers
            usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical
            engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration
            instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering.

                    and
                    train our future leaders with best of education.

                    Our objective is to disseminate knowledge through various forms such as class room training,
                    industrial
                    visit and organise a attractive curriculum for the all ground development of our students.

                    Mechanical engineering is the basic branch of all engineering that why it is known as MOTHER OF
                    ENGINEERING as it add-ons state of art technically and exhilarates solution.

                    Here at NAVSAYADRI education society we attempt to provide cheerful, productive and satisfying
                    experience at all level to explore the amazing world mechanical engineering.

                    With best wishes for a bright future.
