            Pharmacology involves the study of the actions of drugs and chemicals on cells, tissues and the whole body.
            Pharmacological studies may involve gaining knowledge of the mechanism of drug action, drug toxicity, the
            use of drugs as tools to delineate biological processes during health and disease, identification and
            validation of new cellular targets for drug action, and the design and development of new drugs. The aim of
            Pharmacology studies is to improve the way drugs are tested and to give greater benefit in the treatment of
            disease.
