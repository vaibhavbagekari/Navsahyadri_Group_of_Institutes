                <b>HOD Message</b><br>
                Mechanical engineering is a very versatile and evergreen branch of engineering. Mechanical Engineering field deals with the development, design and manufacturing of machines as well as the maintenance of machinery. Mechanical engineer can work in various specialized industries like automotive industries, aerospace industries, chemicals industry, construction industry, defense industry, consumer goods industry, marine industry, materials and metals industry, oil and gas industry, pharmaceuticals industry, power generation industry, rail industry,  dynamic system and control, agricultural sector industries etc. and in software field also. 
                <br><br>
                Mechanical Department has well qualified and dedicated faculties and well developed laboratories. We impart quality engineering education through sound theoretical knowledge, hands on laboratory as well as computational skill and exposure to recent technologies by visiting industries. We are continuously arranging seminars, workshops expert lectures from industry personals on current trends related with mechanical engineering. Students are trained in various industry related softwareâ€™s like CATIA, Ansys etc., to take competitive advantage and for better job opportunities. Students have the opportunities of undergoing different training programs, mini projects, project based learning, internship etc. We provide opportunities for students to participate in various technical events/competitions like, Go-Kart, BAJA championships. Our students take part in sport activities too. We promote students to work on multi-disciplinary projects as well. Regularly students are guided by faculty through guardian faculty mentoring scheme, to achieve academic and personal excellence. Our students have got placed in various reputed multinational companies with attractive packages.
