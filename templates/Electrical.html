                        The Department of Electrical Engineering established in 2010 for undergraduate programme under
                        the Savitribai Phule Pune University. The department runs this programme to cater the ever
                        challenging needs of technical excellence in all areas of electrical engineering such as
                        electronics and circuits, Control & Automation, Power systems, Power electronics & Electrical
                        drives. We combine the inclemency of science, the strength of engineering and thrill of
                        discovery. Our faculty and student continue to advance the state-of-the-art, define new
                        direction for electrical engineering and development in technologies. These advancements help to
                        address critical social challenges in medical science, energy and environment.
                        Quality technical education is provided to the student in the area of Electrical Engineering in
                        order to meet challenges of globalization with the state of art equipment and laboratories
                        computational and audio-visual facilities and good interaction with industry. Navsahyadri have
